Git
1) Go to the project folder
2) run "git init"
3) This folder is now a git local repo, .git folder is created within
4) Then you can make changes here and then push
5) To send these changes to the github repo:
        git add .                     //tells git to note all changes
        git commit -am "Comments"     //Sorta like makes changes ready to implement with a comment to describe the changes
        git push origin               //Makes the actual changes to the github repo


Vagrant commands
1) create a directory where all the files will be
2) create a VagrantFile (the contents are unknown to me)
3) Then run the "vagrant up" command, this will create a server
4) Then run "vagrant ssh" command to connect to the dev runserver
5) within it there is a folder called vagrant "cd /vagrant", it didn't show up when i ran "ls"
6) within this, all the files, folder in the local computer within the project folder are duplicated in this folder
   Synced folder
